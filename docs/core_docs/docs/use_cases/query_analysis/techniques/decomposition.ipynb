    "# Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user asks a question there is no guarantee that the relevant results can be returned with a single query. Sometimes to answer a question we need to split it into distinct sub-questions, retrieve results for each sub-question, and then answer using the cumulative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if a user asks: \"How is Web Voyager different from reflection agents\", and we have one document that explains Web Voyager and one that explains reflection agents but no document that compares the two, then we'd likely get better results by retrieving for both \"What is Web Voyager\" and \"What are reflection agents\" and combining the retrieved documents than by retrieving based on the user question directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of splitting an input into multiple distinct sub-queries is what we refer to as **query decomposition**. It is also sometimes referred to as sub-query generation. In this guide we'll walk through an example of how to do decomposition, using our example of a Q&A bot over the LangChain YouTube videos from the [Quickstart](/docs/use_cases/query_analysis/quickstart)."
