# Output Parsers

Output parsers are responsible for taking the output of an LLM and transforming it to a more suitable format. This is very useful when you are asking the LLM to generate any form of structured data.

Besides having a large collection of different types of output parsers, one distinguishing benefit of LangChain OutputParsers is that many of them support streaming.
